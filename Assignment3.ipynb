    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions enable reuse of code, improve maintainability and scalability.Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. \n",
    "This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "The code in a function run when it is called.\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function? \n",
    "A function is defined by using the def keyword,followed by a name of your choosing, \n",
    "followed by a set of parentheses which hold any parameters the function will take (they can be empty), and ending with a colon.\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "A function call means invoking or calling that function. \n",
    "Unless a function is called there is no use of that function.\n",
    "So the difference between the function and function call is, A function is procedure to achieve a particular\n",
    "result while function call is using this function to achive that task\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    " There's only one global Python scope per program execution. \n",
    "This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten.\n",
    "Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.\n",
    " A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes.\n",
    "The local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result\n",
    "(value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. \n",
    "If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function \n",
    "after the last statement of the called function is executed. \n",
    "In this case, the return value of the called function is undefined\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Variables that are created outside of a function  are known as global variable.\n",
    "Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.\n",
    "Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "x = \"awesome\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def myfunc():\n",
    "  print(\"Python is \" + x)\n",
    "\n",
    "myfunc()\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "None is used to define a null value. \n",
    "It is a data type of the class NoneType object.\n",
    "Assigning a value of None to a variable is one way to reset it to its original, empty state.\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "import spam as s\n",
    "ba=s.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Error handling can be used to notify the user of why the error occurred and gracefully exit the process that caused the error.\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "The try block is used to check some code for errors i.e the code inside the try block will execute when there is no error in the program.\n",
    "Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block.\n",
    "\n",
